        This is an interactive web guide whose goal is to provide a light and
        exciting introduction to the world of quantum computing as it is applied
        to computational biology/bioinformatics. With pharmaceutical companies
        becoming some of the larger of prospective buyers of quantum systems, it
        would be interesting to understand why. The reason lies in how the many
        problems in the world of computational biology gain nontrivial speedup
        from quantum algorithms. The algorithm in focus for this web guide is a
        hybrid-approach (Where hybrid here refers to an algorithm that uses both
        a classical and quantum portion) called Variational Quantum Encoders.
        This technique has shown great promise helping the accuracy and speedup
        of protein folding simulations.{" "}
